Subject: [PATCH 2/3] shmem: fix faulting into a hole, not taking i_mutex

commit 8e205f779d1443a94b5ae81aa359cb535dd3021e upstream.

Commit f00cdc6df7d7 ("shmem: fix faulting into a hole while it's
punched") was buggy: Sasha sent a lockdep report to remind us that
grabbing i_mutex in the fault path is a no-no (write syscall may already
hold i_mutex while faulting user buffer).

We tried a completely different approach (see following patch) but that
proved inadequate: good enough for a rational workload, but not good
enough against trinity - which forks off so many mappings of the object
that contention on i_mmap_mutex while hole-puncher holds i_mutex builds
into serious starvation when concurrent faults force the puncher to fall
back to single-page unmap_mapping_range() searches of the i_mmap tree.

So return to the original umbrella approach, but keep away from i_mutex
this time.  We really don't want to bloat every shmem inode with a new
mutex or completion, just to protect this unlikely case from trinity.
So extend the original with wait_queue_head on stack at the hole-punch
end, and wait_queue item on the stack at the fault end.

This involves further use of i_lock to guard against the races: lockdep
has been happy so far, and I see fs/inode.c:unlock_new_inode() holds
i_lock around wake_up_bit(), which is comparable to what we do here.
i_lock is more convenient, but we could switch to shmem's info->lock.

This issue has been tagged with CVE-2014-4171, which will require commit
f00cdc6df7d7 and this and the following patch to be backported: we
suggest to 3.1+, though in fact the trinity forkbomb effect might go
back as far as 2.6.16, when madvise(,,MADV_REMOVE) came in - or might
not, since much has changed, with i_mmap_mutex a spinlock before 3.0.
Anyone running trinity on 3.0 and earlier? I don't think we need care.
