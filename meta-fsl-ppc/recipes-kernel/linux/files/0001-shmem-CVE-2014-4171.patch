Subject: [PATCH 1/3] shmem: fix faulting into a hole while it's punched

commit f00cdc6df7d7cfcabb5b740911e6788cb0802bdb upstream.

Trinity finds that mmap access to a hole while it's punched from shmem
can prevent the madvise(MADV_REMOVE) or fallocate(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE)
from completing, until the reader chooses to stop; with the puncher's
hold on i_mutex locking out all other writers until it can complete.

It appears that the tmpfs fault path is too light in comparison with its
hole-punching path, lacking an i_data_sem to obstruct it; but we don't
want to slow down the common case.

Extend shmem_fallocate()'s existing range notification mechanism, so
shmem_fault() can refrain from faulting pages into the hole while it's
punched, waiting instead on i_mutex (when safe to sleep; or repeatedly
faulting when not).
