Subject: [PATCH] net: sctp: fix sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce to verify if we/peer is
 AUTH capable

[ Upstream commit ec0223ec48a90cb605244b45f7c62de856403729 ]

RFC4895 introduced AUTH chunks for SCTP; during the SCTP
handshake RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO are negotiated (CHUNKS
being optional though):

  ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
  <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
  -------------------- COOKIE-ECHO -------------------->
  <-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------

A special case is when an endpoint requires COOKIE-ECHO
chunks to be authenticated:

  ---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
  <------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
  ------------------ AUTH; COOKIE-ECHO ---------------->
  <-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------

RFC4895, section 6.3. Receiving Authenticated Chunks says:

  The receiver MUST use the HMAC algorithm indicated in
  the HMAC Identifier field. If this algorithm was not
  specified by the receiver in the HMAC-ALGO parameter in
  the INIT or INIT-ACK chunk during association setup, the
  AUTH chunk and all the chunks after it MUST be discarded
  and an ERROR chunk SHOULD be sent with the error cause
  defined in Section 4.1. [...] If no endpoint pair shared
  key has been configured for that Shared Key Identifier,
  all authenticated chunks MUST be silently discarded. [...]

  When an endpoint requires COOKIE-ECHO chunks to be
  authenticated, some special procedures have to be followed
  because the reception of a COOKIE-ECHO chunk might result
  in the creation of an SCTP association. If a packet arrives
  containing an AUTH chunk as a first chunk, a COOKIE-ECHO
  chunk as the second chunk, and possibly more chunks after
  them, and the receiver does not have an STCB for that
  packet, then authentication is based on the contents of
  the COOKIE-ECHO chunk. In this situation, the receiver MUST
  authenticate the chunks in the packet by using the RANDOM
  parameters, CHUNKS parameters and HMAC_ALGO parameters
  obtained from the COOKIE-ECHO chunk, and possibly a local
  shared secret as inputs to the authentication procedure
  specified in Section 6.3. If authentication fails, then
  the packet is discarded. If the authentication is successful,
  the COOKIE-ECHO and all the chunks after the COOKIE-ECHO
  MUST be processed. If the receiver has an STCB, it MUST
  process the AUTH chunk as described above using the STCB
  from the existing association to authenticate the
  COOKIE-ECHO chunk and all the chunks after it. [...]

Commit bbd0d59809f9 introduced the possibility to receive
and verification of AUTH chunk, including the edge case for
authenticated COOKIE-ECHO. On reception of COOKIE-ECHO,
the function sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce() handles processing,
unpacks and creates a new association if it passed sanity
checks and also tests for authentication chunks being
present. After a new association has been processed, it
invokes sctp_process_init() on the new association and
walks through the parameter list it received from the INIT
chunk. It checks SCTP_PARAM_RANDOM, SCTP_PARAM_HMAC_ALGO
and SCTP_PARAM_CHUNKS, and copies them into asoc->peer
meta data (peer_random, peer_hmacs, peer_chunks) in case
sysctl -w net.sctp.auth_enable=1 is set. If in INIT's
SCTP_PARAM_SUPPORTED_EXT parameter SCTP_CID_AUTH is set,
peer_random != NULL and peer_hmacs != NULL the peer is to be
assumed asoc->peer.auth_capable=1, in any other case
asoc->peer.auth_capable=0.

Now, if in sctp_sf_do_5_1D_ce() chunk->auth_chunk is
available, we set up a fake auth chunk and pass that on to
sctp_sf_authenticate(), which at latest in
sctp_auth_calculate_hmac() reliably dereferences a NULL pointer
at position 0..0008 when setting up the crypto key in
crypto_hash_setkey() by using asoc->asoc_shared_key that is
NULL as condition key_id == asoc->active_key_id is true if
the AUTH chunk was injected correctly from remote. This
happens no matter what net.sctp.auth_enable sysctl says.

The fix is to check for net->sctp.auth_enable and for
asoc->peer.auth_capable before doing any operations like
sctp_sf_authenticate() as no key is activated in
sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key() for each case.

Now as RFC4895 section 6.3 states that if the used HMAC-ALGO
passed from the INIT chunk was not used in the AUTH chunk, we
SHOULD send an error; however in this case it would be better
to just silently discard such a maliciously prepared handshake
as we didn't even receive a parameter at all. Also, as our
endpoint has no shared key configured, section 6.3 says that
MUST silently discard, which we are doing from now onwards.

Before calling sctp_sf_pdiscard(), we need not only to free
the association, but also the chunk->auth_chunk skb, as
commit bbd0d59809f9 created a skb clone in that case.

I have tested this locally by using netfilter's nfqueue and
re-injecting packets into the local stack after maliciously
modifying the INIT chunk (removing RANDOM; HMAC-ALGO param)
and the SCTP packet containing the COOKIE_ECHO (injecting
AUTH chunk before COOKIE_ECHO). Fixed with this patch applied.

This fixes CVE-2014-0101
