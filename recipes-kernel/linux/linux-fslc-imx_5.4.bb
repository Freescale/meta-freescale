SUMMARY = "Linux Kernel provided by NXP and supported by Community"
DESCRIPTION = "Linux Kernel provided by NXP as the part of release distribution. \
Main focus is set on i.MX Family Reference Boards. \
It includes support for many NXP Proprietary IPs (GPU, VPU, IPU). \
Latest stable Kernel patchlevel is applied and maintained by Community."

###############################################################################
# This recipe (and corresponding kernel repository and branch) receives updates
# from 3 different sources:
# 1. Stable [linux-5.4.y] branch updates of korg;
# 2. NXP-specific updates via branch [5.4-2.2.x-imx] shared via CodeAurora forum;
# 3. Critical patches, which are not (yet) integrated into either of 2 above
#    sources, but are required to be applied to the kernel tree.
#
# Therefore, there is a need to keep track on the patches which are introduced
# from every source. This could be achieved in this recipe by filling the
# below list with the information once the update is performed from any source.
#
# Once the critical patch gets merged into the stable branch, or NXP-specific
# patches would be covered by the tag - individual entries from sections below
# could be removed.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Stable (tag or SHA(s))

#    tag: v5.4.114

# 2. NXP-specific (tag or SHA(s))
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    tag: rel_imx_5.4.70_2.3.2
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Critical patches (SHA(s))
