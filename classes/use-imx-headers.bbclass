# Easy use of linux-imx-headers by packages

# This allow to easy reuse of binary packages among similar SoCs. The

# boards independently of the kernel version it is using, as far it is
# ABI compatible with the official version it will just work.

# All recipes using this class ought to depend on linux-imx-headers
# and by default to use MACHINE_SOCARCH.
#
# Please use the STAGING_INCDIR_IMX variable to refer to the installed
# headers.
