#
# This class provides a support to build the boot container for
# i.MX8M derivatives
#
# imx8m machines require a separate build target to be executed
# due to the fact that final boot image is constructed using flash.bin
# taget. It produces a boot binary image, which is constructed from
# various binary components (u-boot with separate dtb, atf, DDR
# firmware and optional op-tee) into a single image using FIT format.
# This flash.bin file is then parsed and loaded either via
# SPL directly (imx8mm), or using bootrom code (imx8mn and imx8mp).
#
# In order to use flash.bin binary boot image, it is required that
# the U-Boot build is to be invoked for an additional build target.
# This class extendes the U-Boot build targets with the "flash.bin",
# which effectively serves as a boot container. It replaces the boot
# container `imx-boot` provided by NXP.
#
# Class inheritance is performed in u-boot-fslc recipe, and is controlled
# by variable UBOOT_PROVIDES_BOOT_CONTAINER, which is defined in the
# base machine include file (imx-base.inc), and is set to "1" when the
# 'imx-boot-container' is present in MACHINEOVERRIDES.

# Extend the UBOOT_MAKE_TARGET with additional target for U-Boot build
# system to produce the boot container
UBOOT_MAKE_TARGET += "flash.bin"

# Define ATF binary file to be deployed to the U-Boot build folder
