Subject: [PATCH 1/5] isp-imx: start_isp: don't report error if no camera is
 configured

The script currently returns '6' when no known camera is configured
in the device tree. The end result is that the systemd imx8-isp.service
goes to the failed state.
Return '0' in that case as obviously the device tree doesn't have a
camera configured and the service is not needed.
